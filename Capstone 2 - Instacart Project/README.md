# Next-Order Predictions with Model Stacking and XGBoost: Instacart User Behavior Predictive Analysis

## Project Summary
This project aims to develop a sophisticated predictive model to forecast the next set of purchases for users based on historical order data from the Instacart dataset, originally featured in a previous Kaggle competition. By leveraging model stacking and the usage of XGBoost we seek to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness. The project is organized into several Jupyter Notebooks, each detailing different stages of the data science workflow.

#  Introduction
Understanding and anticipating customer purchasing behavior is critical for improving user experience and optimizing inventory management in e-commerce platforms. This project uses the Instacart dataset to predict future purchases, enabling personalized recommendations and better operational decisions.

## Problem Statement
The objective is to build a predictive model capable of forecasting the next 'n' purchases for users based on their historical order data. We implement and compare various machine learning models, including logistic regression,XGBoost, and enhancing model performance through model stacking.

## Objectives
-Develop a robust predictive model.
-Compare multiple machine learning approaches.
-Optimize model performance.
-Evaluate models using standard metrics.

## Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simpler approach to predicting user purchases using a combination of traditional machine learning techniques. By integrating model stacking with the combination of independent models, we aim to deliver a highly accurate and robust predictive model, providing valuable insights for personalized recommendations in e-commerce platforms like Instacart.
